# Git Gud: Open-source git-themed card game

## Overview
Git Gud is a strategic card game that simulates the ups and downs of software development and bug tracking. Players use action cards to manage bugs in their repository while affecting others', striving to maintain the lowest bug count. The game ends when a player reaches zero bugs or by mutual agreement when there are no cards left.

## Objectives
- Keep your bug count as low as possible.
- Be the player with the least number of bugs to win.
- If a player reaches 0 bugs, the game immediately ends.

## Setup
- Each player starts with 7 cards.
- Place the rest of the cards face down to form a draw pile.

## Gameplay
1. On your turn, play an action card from your hand.
2. Perform the action on the card.
3. At the end of your turn, draw a card from the pile to have 7 cards in your hand again.
4. If the draw pile runs out, reshuffle the discarded cards to create a new draw pile.

## Cards
- **Introduce bug**: Give another player a bug.
- **Merge**: Trade a card with another player.
- **Fix bug**: Guess and roll to remove bugs.
- **Rebase**: Take a random card from another player.
- **Squash commits**: Discard a card and draw a new one.
- **Commit**: Guess the die roll to remove or add bugs.
- **Retire repo**: Retire your repo to add bugs to the next player.
- **Pair programming**: Collaborate to fix or add bugs.
- **Clone repo**: Refresh your hand based on the die roll.

## Components
- **Cards**: A total of 108 cards are needed to play the game. Print the card sheet 12 times to get the full deck.
- **Dice**: A minimum of 2 six-sided dice (d6) are required for gameplay.

## Printing Instructions
- Use a color printer to ensure the colors of the cards are vivid and clear.
- Print on card stock or any thick paper for durability.
- Cut the cards out along the edges carefully.

## Ending the Game
The game can end in two ways:
- If a player reaches 0 bugs.
- Players decide to end the game when there are no more cards in the draw pile.

## Winner
- The player with the lowest bug count at the end of the game wins.
